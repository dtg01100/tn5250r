# TN52550R Implementation Roadmap

## Goal: Full RFC 2877/4777 Compliance

Based on the protocol comparison, here are the key improvements needed to make TN5250R fully compliant with the 5250 protocol standards:

## Phase 1: Core Protocol Implementation

### 1.1 Telnet Option Negotiation
```rust
// Need to implement proper telnet option negotiation
// IAC DO/WILL/WONT/DONT for required options:
// - BINARY (Transmit Binary) - Option 0
// - EOR (End of Record) - Option 19  
// - SGA (Suppress Go Ahead) - Option 3
```

### 1.2 Environment Variable Negotiation (RFC 1572)
```rust
// Implement NEW-ENVIRON option negotiation
// Support for:
// - VAR: USER, JOB, ACCT, PRINTER, SYSTEMTYPE, DISPLAY
// - USERVAR: DEVNAME, KBDTYPE, CODEPAGE, CHARSET
```

### 1.3 Enhanced Data Stream Parsing
- [ ] Complete the structured field implementation
- [ ] Add support for all 5250 data stream commands
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for malformed streams

## Phase 2: Security Features

### 2.1 SSL/TLS Support
- [ ] Add TLS support for secure connections
- [ ] Implement proper certificate handling
- [ ] Secure password transmission

### 2.2 Auto-Signon Implementation
- [ ] Password encryption as per RFC specification
- [ ] Random server seed handling
- [ ] DES-based password encryption

## Phase 3: Advanced Protocol Features

### 3.1 Complete Command Set
- [ ] Read Buffer (F2) command with proper keyboard response
- [ ] Write Structured Field (F5) with full field definitions
- [ ] Read Structured Field (F6)
- [ ] Write To Display & Identify (F8)
- [ ] Read Buffer & Identify (F9)

### 3.2 Character Set Support
- [ ] EBCDIC to UTF-8 conversion tables
- [ ] Code page negotiation and handling
- [ ] Proper character attribute processing

## Implementation Details

### Example: Telnet Option Negotiation
```rust
pub enum TelnetOption {
    Binary = 0,
    Echo = 1,
    SuppressGoAhead = 3,
    EndOfRecord = 19,
    TerminalType = 24,
    NewEnvironment = 39,
}

pub enum TelnetCommand {
    WILL = 251,
    WONT = 252, 
    DO = 253,
    DONT = 254,
    IAC = 255,  // Interpret As Command
}
```

### Example: Environment Variable Structure
```rust
pub struct EnvironmentVariable {
    pub var_type: EnvironmentVarType,
    pub name: String,
    pub value: String,
}

pub enum EnvironmentVarType {
    Var,      // Standard variables
    UserVar,  // Custom variables
}
```

### Example: Protocol State Machine Updates
The current `ProtocolState` enum needs to include negotiation states:
```rust
pub enum ProtocolState {
    InitialNegotiation,
    NegotiatingTelnetOptions,
    NegotiatingEnvironment,
    Connected,
    Receiving,
    Sending,
    Error,
    Closed,
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test each 5250 command individually
- Test field attribute processing
- Test environment variable negotiation

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test with mock AS/400 server
- Test real connection scenarios

### 3. Compliance Tests
- Test against RFC 2877/4777 specifications
- Test compatibility with existing AS/400 systems

## Testing Against pub400.com

After implementing the core protocol compliance, we should test:

1. **Basic Connection**:
   - Connect to pub400.com
   - Complete telnet option negotiation
   - Verify environment variable exchange

2. **Terminal Functionality**:
   - Test basic display functionality
   - Test function key handling
   - Test field navigation

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Test structured field processing
   - Test secure connection (if supported)
   - Test character encoding

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Rendering Optimization
- Only redraw changed characters on screen
- Implement proper dirty rectangle tracking
- Optimize string conversion operations

### 2. Network Optimization
- Implement proper buffering
- Add support for keep-alive
- Optimize packet handling

## Security Considerations

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust provides inherent memory safety
2. **Buffer Handling**: Proper bounds checking
3. **Connection Security**: TLS/SSL implementation
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data streams

## Migration Path

### Current State â†’ RFC Compliant
1. Add telnet negotiation to network module
2. Update protocol state machine to handle negotiation
3. Add environment variable support
4. Implement missing commands
5. Add character set support
6. Test against pub400.com

## Success Metrics

### 1. Protocol Compliance
- [ ] 100% RFC 2877/4777 compliance
- [ ] Successful negotiation with AS/400 systems
- [ ] Proper handling of all standard commands

### 2. Usability
- [ ] Stable connections to AS/400 systems
- [ ] Proper terminal emulation
- [ ] Good performance characteristics

### 3. Security
- [ ] Memory-safe implementation 
- [ ] Secure connection support
- [ ] Proper input validation

This roadmap will transform TN5250R from a basic terminal emulator into a fully RFC-compliant 5250 protocol implementation suitable for production use.
