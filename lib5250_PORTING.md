# lib5250 Rust Port: Process & Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the process of porting the lib5250 component from the original tn5250 (C) project to Rust, its integration into TN5250R, and the current status of the implementation.

## Porting Process
1. **Architecture Review**
   - Analyzed lib5250 C source for protocol parsing, field management, and telnet negotiation logic.
   - Identified key data structures, command codes, and integration points.
2. **Rust Module Scaffolding**
   - Created `src/lib5250/` with submodules for protocol, field, and telnet logic.
   - Defined enums and public API stubs for each area.
3. **Integration with TN5250R**
   - Refactored TN5250R protocol, field, and telnet layers to delegate to lib5250 Rust APIs.
   - Ensured thread safety and async compatibility.
4. **Testing**
   - Added unit tests for stubbed logic in protocol, field, and telnet modules.
   - Ran integration tests with TN5250R suite (basic features pass, advanced features pending).

## Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Design**: lib5250 port is split into protocol, field, and telnet modules for clarity and maintainability.
- **Async Compatibility**: All integration points use thread-safe patterns (Arc<Mutex<>>).
- **Feature Parity Goal**: The port aims for full compatibility with the original lib5250, including advanced telnet and field features.

## Integration Points
- `protocol_state.rs`: Protocol parsing now calls `lib5250::protocol::parse_5250_stream`.
- `field_manager.rs`: Field detection now calls `lib5250::field::detect_fields_from_screen`.
- `telnet_negotiation.rs`: Telnet negotiation logic to be ported to `lib5250::telnet`.

## Current Status
- **Stubbed Implementation**: Most logic is currently stubbed; only basic command dispatch and detection are implemented.
- **Unit Tests**: All stubbed logic is covered by passing unit tests.
- **Integration**: TN5250R uses lib5250 stubs for protocol and field handling; advanced features are not yet implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Incrementally implement full protocol parsing, field management, and telnet negotiation logic in Rust.
2. Expand unit and integration tests to cover all protocol features and edge cases.
3. Optimize for performance and maintainability.
4. Document further architectural decisions and migration steps.
