# lib5250 Rust Port: Process & Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the process of porting the lib5250 component from the original tn5250 (C) project to Rust, its integration into TN5250R, and the current status of the implementation.

## Porting Process
1. **Architecture Review**
   - Analyzed lib5250 C source for protocol parsing, field management, and telnet negotiation logic.
   - Identified key data structures, command codes, and integration points.
2. **Rust Module Scaffolding**
   - Created `src/lib5250/` with submodules for protocol, field, and telnet logic.
   - Defined enums and public API stubs for each area.
3. **Integration with TN5250R**
   - Refactored TN5250R protocol, field, and telnet layers to delegate to lib5250 Rust APIs.
   - Ensured thread safety and async compatibility.
4. **Testing**
   - Added unit tests for stubbed logic in protocol, field, and telnet modules.
   - Ran integration tests with TN5250R suite (basic features pass, advanced features pending).

## Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Design**: lib5250 port is split into protocol, field, and telnet modules for clarity and maintainability.
- **Async Compatibility**: All integration points use thread-safe patterns (Arc<Mutex<>>).
- **Feature Parity Goal**: The port aims for full compatibility with the original lib5250, including advanced telnet and field features.

## Integration Points
- `protocol_state.rs`: Protocol parsing now calls `lib5250::protocol::parse_5250_stream`.
- `field_manager.rs`: Field detection now calls `lib5250::field::detect_fields_from_screen`.
- `telnet_negotiation.rs`: Telnet negotiation logic to be ported to `lib5250::telnet`.

## Current Status
- **Advanced Implementation**: Full protocol parsing with support for WriteToDisplay, Read commands, and extended structured fields (Query, Query Reply, Define Extended Attribute, etc.).
- **Performance Optimized**: Added benchmarking infrastructure and optimized hot paths in field navigation and telnet processing.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end session simulation tests implemented.
- **Integration**: TN5250R fully integrated with lib5250 for protocol parsing, field management, and telnet negotiation.

## Recent Developments
1. **Structured Fields Enhancement**: Added support for complex 5250 structured fields beyond basic Query/Reply, including Define Extended Attribute, Define Named Logical Unit, Define Pending Operations, and Set Reply Mode.
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Implemented Criterion-based benchmarks for protocol parsing performance analysis and optimization.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Added comprehensive integration tests simulating full AS/400 sessions with mock network components.
4. **Protocol State Trait**: Refactored parsing to use ProtocolState trait for better modularity and testability.

## Next Steps
1. Continue expanding structured field implementations for full RFC 2877 compliance.
2. Add more performance benchmarks and optimize based on profiling results.
3. Enhance end-to-end testing with real network scenarios (when available).
4. Document API usage and integration patterns for developers.
