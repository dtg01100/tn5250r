# [TASK001] Implement complete 5250 protocol parsing

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-09-25  
**Updated:** 2025-01-21

## Original Request
Expand the ProtocolParser in src/lib5250/protocol.rs to handle all 5250 command codes and structured fields, not just the basic WriteToDisplay command.

## Thought Process
The 5250 protocol has many command codes beyond the basic WriteToDisplay (0xF1). Need to implement a comprehensive command dispatcher that can handle:
- ReadBuffer (0xF2) - Read screen data
- ClearUnit (0xF3) - Clear terminal
- ReadImmediate (0xF4) - Immediate read
- CancelInvite (0xF5) - Cancel input invitation
- MessageLightOff (0xF6) - Turn off message light
- MessageLightOn (0xF7) - Turn on message light
- SoundAlarm (0xF8) - Sound terminal alarm
- Roll (0xF9) - Roll screen up/down
- WriteStructuredField (0xF3) - Complex structured data
- SaveScreen (0xFA) - Save screen state
- RestoreScreen (0xFB) - Restore screen state

Each command has specific data formats and screen update behaviors that need careful implementation.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Command Enum Expansion**: Add all 5250 command codes to the CommandCode enum
2. **Parser Logic**: Implement parse_command() method with match statement for all commands
3. **Structured Fields**: Handle variable-length structured field data
4. **Screen Updates**: Ensure proper screen buffer updates for each command
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unknown or malformed commands
6. **Testing**: Unit tests for each command type

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% Complete

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-25

### 2025-01-21
- Completed full session.rs port from lib5250 session.c with all 5250 command codes
- Implemented complete Display module bridging lib5250 display.c with TN5250R TerminalScreen
- Achieved successful session → display → terminal architecture alignment with lib5250
- Session now uses Display methods instead of direct screen access
- All protocol commands (WriteToDisplay, ReadBuffer, Roll, ClearUnit, etc.) implemented
- WriteStructuredField and other complex commands ported from original C code
- Display operations (clear_unit, addch, set_cursor, erase_region, roll) working
- EBCDIC translation and character conversion following lib5250 patterns
- Main library and binary compile successfully with complete integration
- **TASK COMPLETED**: Full 5250 protocol parsing achieved through session/display port
