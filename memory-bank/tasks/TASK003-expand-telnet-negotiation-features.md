# [TASK003] Expand telnet negotiation features

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-09-25  
**Updated:** 2025-09-26

## Original Request
Expand the TelnetNegotiator in src/lib5250/telnet.rs to support advanced telnet options including environment variables and terminal types.

## Thought Process
Basic telnet negotiation (Binary, EOR, SGA) is working, but 5250 connections often require additional options:
- **NEW-ENVIRON**: For passing environment variables like user ID, password for auto-signon
- **TERMINAL-TYPE**: To specify terminal capabilities (IBM-5250, etc.)
- **Other options**: Status, timing, etc. as needed

The negotiation process is complex with proper state management:
- Client sends WILL/WONT/DO/DONT
- Server responds with DO/DONT/WILL/WONT
- Options have sub-negotiation phases
- Environment variables use specific formatting

## Implementation Plan
1. **NEW-ENVIRON Option**: Implement environment variable negotiation
2. **TERMINAL-TYPE Option**: Add terminal capability negotiation
3. **Sub-negotiation Handling**: Support complex option data exchange
4. **State Management**: Proper negotiation state tracking
5. **Auto-signon Support**: Environment variable passing for authentication
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful negotiation failure handling

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% Complete (comprehensive telnet negotiation enhancements)
