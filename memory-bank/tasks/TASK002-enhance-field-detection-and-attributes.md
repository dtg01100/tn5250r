# [TASK002] Enhance field detection and attributes

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-09-25
**Updated:** 2025-10-08

## Original Request
Expand the field detection in src/lib5250/field.rs to support all field attributes and types, not just basic underscore detection.

## Thought Process
AS/400 screens have complex field systems beyond just detecting underscores. Fields have attributes that control:
- **Display characteristics**: Intensified, non-display, reverse image
- **Input properties**: Protected vs unprotected, numeric-only
- **Behavior**: Auto-enter, mandatory fill, right-to-left
- **Validation**: Field length, data type restrictions

The current implementation only detects underscores, but real fields have specific attribute bytes that define their properties. Need to parse the 5250 field format which includes:
- Field start/end positions
- Attribute bytes (color, protection, etc.)
- Length and data type information
- Tab stop and navigation properties

## Implementation Plan
1. **Field Attribute Parsing**: Parse 5250 field attribute format ✅
2. **Field Type Detection**: Identify numeric, alpha, protected fields ✅
3. **Display Attributes**: Handle intensified, hidden, colored fields ✅
4. **Navigation Logic**: Implement tab order and field jumping
5. **Validation Rules**: Enforce field constraints
6. **Edge Case Handling**: Multi-line fields, overlapping fields
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all field types ✅

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% Complete (field management fully implemented in both 5250 and 3270 libraries)

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-25
- Recognized that current underscore detection is insufficient
- Identified need for complete 5250 field attribute parsing
- Planned systematic approach to field enhancement
- Current status: Basic field structure exists, need full attribute support

### 2025-09-25 (Latest Update)
- Implemented parse_field_attribute() function for protocol-compliant attribute parsing
- Added detect_fields_from_protocol_data() for raw 5250 data parsing
- Integrated with existing FieldAttribute enum from protocol.rs
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering Protected, Numeric, Normal, and Mandatory attributes
- All 7 field-related tests passing successfully
- Field attribute parsing now ~85% complete with basic parsing implemented

### 2025-10-08 (Final Completion)
- Field management completed in both 5250 and 3270 libraries
- Protocol attribute application and field modification implemented
- Display attribute functions properly implemented
- Field navigation (tab order, field jumping) implemented
- Field validation logic (length, type, mandatory checks) implemented
- Complex field layouts (multi-line, overlapping fields) supported
- Cross-library compatibility achieved
- All field-related tests passing (7/7)
- Task marked 100% complete
