# TN5250R Lib5250 Port Project Brief

## Project Overview
TN5250R is a cross-platform IBM AS/400 terminal emulator written in Rust. This project involves creating a complete Rust port of the lib5250 library from the tn5250 project and integrating it as a replacement for TN5250R's existing 5250 protocol implementation.

## Core Requirements
- Create a faithful Rust port of lib5250's core functionality
- Maintain full compatibility with IBM 5250 protocol (RFC 2877/4777)
- Replace TN5250R's existing protocol/field/telnet implementations
- Ensure thread-safe, performant, and maintainable code
- Provide comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Success Criteria
- All existing TN5250R functionality preserved
- Full 5250 protocol support including structured fields, field attributes, and telnet negotiation
- Zero regressions in existing tests
- Clean, idiomatic Rust code following best practices
- Complete documentation of the porting process

## Scope
- Protocol parsing (command codes, structured fields, EBCDIC translation)
- Field management (detection, attributes, input handling)
- Telnet negotiation (options, environment variables, terminal types)
- Integration with TN5250R's controller, terminal, and GUI layers

## Out of Scope
- GUI framework changes
- Network layer modifications beyond telnet negotiation
- Non-5250 protocol support

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing TN5250R API compatibility
- Rust 2021 edition or later
- No unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
- Memory-safe implementation with proper error handling

## Stakeholders
- Primary: TN5250R maintainer (user)
- Secondary: Future contributors who will maintain the port

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Scaffolding and integration (completed)
- Phase 2: Core protocol implementation (in progress)
- Phase 3: Advanced features and optimization (pending)
- Phase 4: Testing and validation (pending)
