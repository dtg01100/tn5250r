# TN5250R Active Context

#### Telnet Module (`src/lib5250/telnet.rs`)
- **Completed**: Full TelnetNegotiator with state management, NEW-ENVIRON and TERMINAL-TYPE options, sub-negotiation support
- **Status**: Advanced telnet features implemented, ready for testingrent Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Deepening the lib5250 Rust port implementation with real protocol, field, and telnet logic to achieve full feature parity with the original C library.

### Immediate Tasks
- **Protocol Parsing**: Expand ProtocolParser to handle all 5250 command codes and structured fields
- **Field Detection**: Implement complete field attribute parsing (numeric, intensified, protected, etc.)
- **Telnet Negotiation**: Add support for environment variables, terminal types, and advanced options
- **Testing**: Ensure all new logic passes unit tests and integration doesn't break existing functionality

## Recent Changes

### Display Module (`src/lib5250/display.rs`) - COMPLETED
- **Complete lib5250 Port**: Full implementation of display.c functions (clear_unit, addch, set_cursor, erase_region, roll)
- **Session Integration**: Session successfully updated to use Display instead of direct TerminalScreen
- **Architecture Compliance**: Proper lib5250 session → display → terminal layering established
- **Compilation Success**: All display operations compile and integrate correctly
- **EBCDIC Handling**: Complete character translation following lib5250 patterns

### Session Module (`src/lib5250/session.rs`) - MAJOR PROGRESS
- **Complete Command Processing**: All 5250 protocol commands ported from session.c
- **Display Integration**: Session now properly calls Display methods instead of direct screen access
- **Architecture Alignment**: Follows original lib5250 patterns for session management
- **Compilation Ready**: Session module compiles successfully with Display integration

### Protocol Module (`src/lib5250/protocol.rs`)
- Added ProtocolParser struct with command dispatch logic
- Implemented EBCDIC to ASCII translation table
- Added basic command parsing for WriteToDisplay (0xF1)
- Integrated with TN5250R's protocol_state.rs via delegation

### Field Module (`src/lib5250/field.rs`)
- Created Field struct with position and attribute tracking
- Implemented basic underscore-based field detection
- Added detect_fields_from_screen() function
- Integrated with field_manager.rs

### Telnet Module (`src/lib5250/telnet.rs`)
- Added TelnetNegotiator struct for option negotiation
- Implemented basic Binary, EOR, and SGA option checking
- Added negotiation state tracking
- Ready for expansion to advanced features

### Integration Points
- Updated protocol_state.rs to delegate parsing to lib5250::protocol
- Modified field_manager.rs to use lib5250::field for detection
- All existing TN5250R tests still pass (25/25)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Delegation over Replacement**: Keeping TN5250R's existing structure and delegating to lib5250 modules rather than wholesale replacement
- **Struct-Based Design**: Using structs for parsers/negotiators to maintain state, following Rust best practices
- **Incremental Implementation**: Adding real logic gradually with tests to ensure stability

### Technical Considerations
- **EBCDIC Translation**: Need complete EBCDIC table for all character mappings
- **Structured Fields**: Complex 5250 commands require careful parsing of variable-length data
- **Thread Safety**: Ensuring lib5250 components work correctly in multi-threaded TN5250R environment
- **Error Handling**: Balancing robustness with performance in protocol parsing

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next Session)
1. **Expand Protocol Commands**: Implement remaining 5250 command codes (ReadBuffer, ClearUnit, etc.)
2. **Field Attributes**: Add support for all field types (numeric, intensified, hidden, etc.)
3. **Telnet Environment**: Implement NEW-ENVIRON option for auto-signon capabilities
4. **Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for edge cases and error conditions

### Medium Term
1. **Structured Field Parsing**: Handle complex 5250 structured fields
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
3. **Integration Testing**: Full end-to-end tests with real AS/400 connections
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update lib5250_PORTING.md with implementation details

### Long Term
1. **Feature Parity**: Ensure 100% compatibility with original lib5250
2. **Code Review**: Clean up and optimize implementation
3. **Migration Completion**: Remove old protocol code once lib5250 is proven

## Known Issues and Blockers

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic scaffolding and integration complete
- ✅ Unit tests passing for implemented features
- ✅ No regressions in existing TN5250R functionality
- ⚠️ Protocol parsing incomplete (only basic commands)
- ⚠️ Field detection basic (underscore detection only)
- ⚠️ Telnet negotiation minimal (core options only)

### Potential Risks
- **Protocol Complexity**: 5250 structured fields are complex; parsing errors could cause connection issues
- **EBCDIC Edge Cases**: Some character mappings may need special handling
- **Performance Impact**: New Rust implementation must match or exceed C performance
- **Threading Issues**: Async integration needs careful testing

## Testing Strategy

### Current Testing
- Unit tests for each lib5250 module
- Integration tests ensuring TN5250R still works
- Manual testing with local telnet servers

### Planned Testing
- Comprehensive protocol parsing tests with real 5250 data
- Field detection accuracy tests
- Telnet negotiation compliance tests
- Performance benchmarks comparing old vs new implementation
