# GUI Test Compilation Fix Summary

## Issue
The GUI test suite was failing to compile with errors about unresolved modules `components` and `integration`.

## Root Cause
The test files were attempting to import modules as if they were external crates:
```rust
use components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;
use integration::mock_network::{MockAS400Connection, MockScenario};
```

However, in Rust's test binary system, these are local modules within the same crate and must be accessed via the `crate::` prefix.

## Solution
Updated all import statements in the GUI test files to use the correct `crate::` prefix:

### Files Modified

1. **tests/gui/components/test_ui_components.rs**
   - Changed: `use components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`
   - To: `use crate::components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`

2. **tests/gui/integration/test_connection.rs**
   - Changed: `use components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`
   - To: `use crate::components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`
   - Changed: `use integration::mock_network::{MockAS400Connection, MockScenario};`
   - To: `use crate::integration::mock_network::{MockAS400Connection, MockScenario};`

3. **tests/gui/visual/test_visual_regression.rs**
   - Changed: `use components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`
   - To: `use crate::components::test_harness::TN5250RHarness;`
   - Changed: `use integration::mock_network::MockScenario;`
   - To: `use crate::integration::mock_network::MockScenario;`

4. **tests/gui/visual/mock_network.rs**
   - Changed: `use tn5250r::network::AS400Connection;`
   - To: `use crate::integration::mock_network::Connection;`
   - Changed: `impl AS400Connection for MockAS400Connection {`
   - To: `impl Connection for MockAS400Connection {`

## Module Structure
The test suite uses a hierarchical module structure declared in `tests/gui/main.rs`:
```rust
pub mod components;  // Contains test_harness and test_ui_components
pub mod integration; // Contains mock_network, test_connection, test_harness
pub mod visual;      // Contains mock_network, test_visual_regression
```

All modules are declared as `pub mod` to enable cross-module imports within the test binary.

## Verification
After the fixes, the test suite compiles successfully:
```bash
$ cargo test --test gui
   Compiling tn5250r v0.1.0 (/workspaces/tn5250r)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 19.38s
     Running tests/gui/main.rs (target/debug/deps/gui-66e75b70a7ed928d)
Running TN5250R GUI Test Suite...
GUI test suite initialized. Run with: cargo test --test gui
```

## Status
✅ All compilation errors resolved
✅ Test suite compiles successfully
✅ Ready for test implementation and expansion

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual test cases in the test framework
2. Add connection workflow tests
3. Implement visual regression testing
4. Validate CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
