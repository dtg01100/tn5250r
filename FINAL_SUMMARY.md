- **Error Handling**: Proper Result-based error management
- **Extensible Design**: Modular components for easy enhancement

## RFC Compliance Status

### Currently Implemented
- Basic 5250 data stream processing
- Field attribute handling (protected, numeric, skip fields)
- Character and cursor positioning
- Connection establishment and data transfer

### Compliance Gaps (Future Enhancements)
- Full Telnet option negotiation (BINARY, EOR, SGA)
- RFC 1572 environment variable negotiation
- Complete structured field support
- SSL/TLS security
- Auto-signon with encrypted passwords

## Comparison Summary

### vs TN5250 (C Implementation)
- **Our Advantage**: Modern language with memory safety, smaller binary size
- **Their Advantage**: 20+ years of maturity, full RFC compliance
- **Verdict**: TN5250R provides safer foundation, TN5250 provides complete implementation

### vs TN5250J (Java Implementation) 
- **Our Advantage**: Faster startup, lower memory usage, better security
- **Their Advantage**: Mature UI, extensive session management
- **Verdict**: TN5250R more efficient and secure, TN5250J feature-completed

### Competitive Position
TN5250R sits in a unique position with:
- Modern language benefits (safety, performance, maintainability)
- Clean, modular architecture
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Room for protocol completeness expansion

## Production Readiness

### Ready for Use ✅
- Solid foundation for terminal emulation
- Safe memory management (no crashes)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Command-line interface for automation
- Standard packaging formats (AppImage, single exe, etc.)

### Production Enhancements Needed ⚠️
- Full RFC compliance for all AS/400 systems
- SSL/TLS for secure connections
- Performance optimization for large screens
- Comprehensive testing against real systems

## Future Development Path

### Immediate Next Steps
