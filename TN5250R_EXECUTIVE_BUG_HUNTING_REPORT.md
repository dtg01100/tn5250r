## Long-Term Architectural Recommendations

### 1. Security-First Architecture

**Implement Defense-in-Depth Strategy:**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Input Validation] --> B[Authentication]
    B --> C[Authorization]
    C --> D[Secure Processing]
    D --> E[Output Sanitization]
    
    F[Audit Logging] --> G[Monitoring]
    G --> H[Alerting]
    
    I[Secure Defaults] --> J[Fail-Safe Design]
    J --> K[Regular Updates]
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Zero-trust security model** - Validate all inputs, authenticate all requests
- **Secure by default** - Disable insecure options, require explicit opt-in for legacy features
- **Defense in depth** - Multiple security layers at network, protocol, and application levels
- **Fail-safe design** - Graceful degradation without compromising security

### 2. Protocol Compliance Framework

**RFC 2877/4777 Complete Implementation:**
- Structured field processing with comprehensive validation
- Complete telnet option negotiation state machine
- Proper error response codes and handling
- Full environment variable support

**NVT Mode Fallback Architecture:**
- Automatic protocol detection and switching
- Graceful degradation to ASCII/VT100 mode
- Seamless transition between protocol modes

### 3. Performance-by-Design Architecture

**Async-First Design Pattern:**
```rust
// Replace blocking I/O with async throughout
pub struct AsyncTN5250Connection {
    stream: Box<dyn AsyncReadWrite + Send + Unpin>,
    protocol_processor: AsyncProtocolProcessor,
    buffer_pool: OptimizedBufferPool,
    metrics_collector: PerformanceMetrics,
}
```

**Memory Management Strategy:**
- Lock-free buffer pooling for high-performance scenarios
- Pre-allocated lookup tables for character conversion
- Connection pooling for concurrent session management
- Smart caching for frequently accessed protocol data

### 4. Cross-Platform Abstraction Layer

**Platform Independence Architecture:**
```rust
pub mod cross_platform {
    pub trait PlatformServices {
        fn get_config_path() -> PathBuf;
        fn get_certificate_stores() -> Vec<PathBuf>;
        fn get_display_capabilities() -> DisplayInfo;
        fn get_network_interfaces() -> Vec<NetworkInterface>;
    }
}
```

**Consistent Behavior Across Platforms:**
- Unified configuration management
- Standardized certificate validation
- Consistent terminal capabilities
- Platform-agnostic networking
