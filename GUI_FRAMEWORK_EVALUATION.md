# GUI Framework Evaluation for TN5250R

## Requirements for TN5250R GUI Framework

- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Good performance for terminal emulation
- Customizable UI components
- Good text rendering capabilities
- Active community and maintenance
- Compatibility with Rust's async ecosystem
- Native look and feel on each platform

## Framework Options Evaluated

### 1. Iced

**Pros:**
- Modern, declarative GUI framework
- Cross-platform with native look
- Strong performance
- Good documentation and community
- Inspired by Elm architecture, making code predictable
- Good support for custom styling
- Active development

**Cons:**
- Younger project (relative to others)
- May require more custom components for terminal emulation
- Text rendering capabilities might need additional work for terminal use case

**Verdict:** Strong candidate, particularly good for modern cross-platform applications.

### 2. egui (egui: "easy GUI")

**Pros:**
- Immediate mode GUI with excellent performance
- Very active development
- Great for custom drawing and rendering
- Good for terminal emulation interfaces
- Excellent documentation
- Works well with graphics-intensive applications
- Cross-platform

**Cons:**
- Different paradigm (immediate mode) vs. retained mode
- May require more code for basic UI patterns
- Themed look rather than native look

**Verdict:** Strong candidate, especially suitable for custom rendering like terminal emulation.

### 3. Tauri

**Pros:**
- Web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) with Rust backend
- Extremely lightweight applications
- Web ecosystem for UI components
- Excellent for complex UIs
- Very small binary sizes

**Cons:**
- Not native UI (web-based)
- Web technologies may not be ideal for terminal emulation performance
- Security considerations with web-based UI
- Not truly native look and feel

**Verdict:** Not ideal for terminal emulator with high performance requirements.

### 4. Winit + Pixels + others

**Pros:**
- Maximum control over rendering and UI
- Excellent performance for custom rendering
- Perfect for terminal emulation
- Direct access to graphics APIs

**Cons:**
- More work required to build UI components
- Need to implement many UI elements from scratch
- Steep learning curve
- More complex than other options

**Verdict:** Good for maximum performance but requires more development work.

### 5. GTK-rs

**Pros:**
- Native on Linux
- Good documentation
- Mature framework
- Good accessibility support

**Cons:**
- Not native on other platforms
- UI looks like GTK on all platforms
- Can be heavy on non-Linux platforms

**Verdict:** Not suitable for truly cross-platform native look.

## Recommendation: egui

After evaluating the options, I recommend **egui** for the TN5250R project for the following reasons:

1. **Performance**: Immediate mode GUI is excellent for terminal emulation where the display updates frequently
2. **Custom Rendering**: Perfect for implementing a terminal display with custom character rendering
3. **Cross-platform**: Works on all target platforms
4. **Active Development**: Well-maintained with an active community
5. **Terminal Suitability**: egui's approach is ideal for applications that need to draw custom content like a terminal emulator
6. **Integration**: Easy to integrate with networking and other Rust libraries

## Implementation Plan

1. Add egui and related dependencies to Cargo.toml
2. Implement a basic egui application window
3. Create a custom terminal widget for character display
4. Implement keyboard handling for AS/400 function keys
5. Add configuration options for colors, fonts, etc.

## Additional Dependencies to Add

- `egui` - Core egui library
- `eframe` - egui framework for applications
- `epi` - egui plugin interface (if needed)
